# Coauthor Network #

This repository contains the source code used in the paper <paper citation>.  The coauthor network can be created from a list of Scopus IDs using the master script `build_network.py`.  See that script for further instructions.  

The folder `analysis` contains `R` and `Rmd` files used to analyze the resulting metadata and network.
